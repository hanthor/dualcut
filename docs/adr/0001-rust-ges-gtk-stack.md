# ADR 0001: Rust + GStreamer Editing Services + GTK4/libadwaita

Date: 2026-07-18 · Status: accepted

## Context
The native rewrite needed a language and media stack. Constraints: no DOM,
no WebKitGTK, GPU acceleration, GNOME app, Flatpak deliverable.

## Decision
Rust, with GES as the editing engine, gtk4paintablesink for preview,
GTK4/libadwaita for UI, Vello/wgpu for vector graphics, and
rustyscript/deno_core for embedded TypeScript.

## Rationale
Rust is the only ecosystem with all four pillars (survey in ROADMAP.md):
GES gives timeline/layers/clips/transitions/rendering for free with
maintained bindings; Go has no NLE layer; GJS cannot embed user TS or do
custom GPU compositing.

## Consequences
- GES objects are not Send: all GStreamer work stays on one thread;
  scripts and workers exchange *documents*, never GES handles.
- GES pipelines are single-timeline: live reload rebuilds the pipeline.
- The GNOME runtime lacks GES; the Flatpak builds it from source.
